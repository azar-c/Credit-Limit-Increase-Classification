🏦 Credit Limit Increase Eligibility Prediction
📘 Overview

This project demonstrates how to use Snowflake ML and Snowpark to build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that predicts which customers are eligible for a credit limit increase.
The solution covers the complete lifecycle — from data preparation to model training, evaluation, and deployment — all within the Snowflake ecosystem.

🎯 Objective

To develop a predictive model that enables financial institutions to make data-driven, risk-aware decisions about customer credit limit increases.

⚙️ Use Case Description

Financial institutions often review customer profiles to decide whether they qualify for a credit limit increase.
This project uses Snowflake ML to analyze:

Customer demographics

Transaction patterns

Repayment behavior

Credit utilization trends

The trained model predicts eligibility, helping automate the credit review process while ensuring responsible lending.
