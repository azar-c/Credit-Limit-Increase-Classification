Use Case: Predicting Credit Limit Increase Eligibility 

Objective:
Build an ML model to predict which customers are eligible for a credit limit increase, helping financial institutions make data-driven, risk-aware decisions.

Overview:
This use case demonstrates how to use Snowflake ML and Snowpark to develop an end-to-end predictive pipeline, from data preparation to model training, evaluation, and deployment. 
Participants will explore how customer demographics, transaction patterns, repayment behavior, and credit utilization influence eligibility.

Key Learning Outcomes:
  •	Understand the ML workflow for credit decisioning using Snowpark ML.
  •	Perform data Preprocessing
  •	Train and register models using the Snowflake Model Registry.
  •	Deploy the model and interpret predictions using Snowpark ML and SPCS (optional).

Business Impact:
Automates credit review, enhances risk management, and improves customer satisfaction through faster, fairer credit decisions.
